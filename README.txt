**********
Subdomain Enumerator
********** 
The Subdomain Enumerator will do exactly as the name implies. 

The script is intended to be ran from the terminal. 

Note: The included wordlist2.txt file should be in the same directory as 
the script in order for it to work as is. If you would like to store your 
wordlist2.txt file in a different directory, you must change the sub_list 
variable to the path in which your wordlist will be. 

Use: python3 
subdomainEnumerator.py google.com

Happy enumerating!
